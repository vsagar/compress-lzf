 * Abstract class that defines "push" style API for various uncompressors

 * based uncompressors (such as {@link com.infinitemonkeys.compress.lzf.LZFInputStream})
 * in cases where "push" operation is important and/or blocking is not allowed;
 * for example, when handling asynchronous HTTP responses.
 *<p>
 * Note that API does not define the way that listener is attached: this is
 * typically passed through to constructor of the implementation.
